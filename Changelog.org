** TODO Wed Sep 16, 2015 [0/0]

*** TODO 10:20:09 Setup up program structure and parsing requirements. [0/2]
**** STARTED Determine architecture [1/4]

***** STARTED server.c and client.c or just server.c
       I'm currently thinking I just need server.c, and the client will
       be minicom.  

      ( Wasn't sure at first if I needed both client.c and
      server.c. Will ask Eric to confirm this.)   

***** STARTED (http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/01_intro.html ) determine difference between libevent (event2/event.h ) and plain sys/socket.h calls

***** DONE add some example code to start
      CLOSED: [2015-09-16 Wed 11:37]

      To start, I'm using my old server which is a modification from 

      http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm

      Still need a makefile.

***** TODO fill in makefile for example code
**** TODO Fill in architecture using socket.h or event.h
